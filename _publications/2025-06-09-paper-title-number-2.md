excerpt: 'Mobile dating applications (MDAs), ubiquitous dating platforms worldwide, have revolutionized ways by which individuals establish intimate relationships. While scholars extensively studied self-presentation on MDAs, primarily focusing on Western gay males in a single cultural context, little attention has been paid to female migrants’ online self-presentation in cross-cultural contexts. Based on 30 semi-structured interviews, this research adopted Adam Isaiah Green’s sexual field framework to investigate UK-based female Chinese international students’ self-presentation on MDAs. Findings suggested that, in the UK, most participants presented more full-body less-beautified outdoor photos than in China. They attributed the changes to their transient migration to the UK, a “period of empowerment” that enabled them to resist the Chinese patriarchal beauty standards—fair-skinned, young and slim (_baiyoushou_ 白幼瘦). However, this research argues that transnational mobility did not shelter these women free from the male gaze and patriarchal beauty standards. Western patriarchal beauty standards, especially the Kardashian-style body image, largely impacted these women’s self-presentation in the UK. Non-compliance with Western beauty standards subjected participants to body shaming and marginalization on Western MDAs. This research sheds light on the intricate interplay between digital self-presentation, female (dis)empowerment and transnational mobility among female Chinese international students.'
