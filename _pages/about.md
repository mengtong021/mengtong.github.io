👋Hello there, I'm Tong! I hold a PhD in the Sociology of Education from [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/). My research sits at the intersection of digital intimacy, gender, and international student mobility, with a particular focus on Chinese international students. 

My doctoral research explores how Chinese international students perceive and experience mobile dating applications, and how dating app use reshapes their understandings and practices of intimacy in transnational contexts. I am always open to conversations and collaborations with scholars working on related topics, including digital intimacy, gender, intercultural communication, migration, Bourdieu's theory and China studies.

I received my MA degree in TESOL with Distinction from [Institute of Education, University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/) in 2019 and my BA in English language and literature from [Taiyuan University of Technology](https://english.tyut.edu.cn/) in 2018.


# Selected Experiences
## 📖Publications
Based on my PhD research, I have published two articles: one on [female Chinese international students’ racial preferences on dating apps](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13607804251320487) in _Sociological Research Online_, and another on their [online self-presentation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14680777.2025.2514793) in _Feminist Media Studies_.

My research on Chinese international students' self-presentation on dating apps has been reported in [Sixth Tone](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1017417).

## 🧑‍🏫Teaching experiences
I have worked as a teaching assistant for several courses at Durham University, including _Cultural Identity, Interculturality and Education_; _Contemporary Issues and Evidence in Education_; and _Double Dissertation: Disciplinary Contexts of Education_. I also delivered several lectures across these courses and gave a guest lecture for the module _Culture and Society of Contemporary China_ at the University of Nottingham. I also served as a keynote speaker at the Master’s conference held by the School of Education at Durham University. Prior to this, I worked as a TOEFL teacher at New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. for around two years.
