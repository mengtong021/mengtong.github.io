I have served as a teaching assistant and guest lecturer for several undergraduate and postgraduate courses at Durham University. My teaching experience includes both seminars, lectures, and curriculum support.

### Courses taught
- *Cultural Identity, Interculturality and Education*
- *Contemporary Issues and Evidence in Education*
- *Double Dissertation: Disciplinary Contexts of Education*

In addition to my teaching at Durham University, I delivered a guest lecture for the module *Culture and Society of Contemporary China* at the University of Nottingham, focusing on contemporary Chinese society and cultural norms.

### TOEFL Teaching Experience

Prior to my academic teaching roles, I worked as a TOEFL instructor at New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. in Shanghai for around two years. I was responsible for teaching TOEFL reading and writing, designing course materials, and supporting students in developing academic English skills for overseas study.
