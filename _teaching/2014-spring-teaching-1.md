I have served as a teaching assistant and guest lecturer for several undergraduate and postgraduate courses at Durham University. My teaching experience includes both seminars, lectures, and curriculum support.

### Courses taught
- *Cultural Identity, Interculturality and Education*
- *Contemporary Issues and Evidence in Education*
- *Double Dissertation: Disciplinary Contexts of Education*

In addition to my teaching at Durham University, I delivered a guest lecture for the module *Culture and Society of Contemporary China* at the University of Nottingham, focusing on contemporary Chinese society and cultural norms.
