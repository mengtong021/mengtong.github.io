👋Hello there, I'm Tong! I hold a PhD in the Sociology of Education from [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/). My research interests include digital intimacy, dating apps, transient migration, intercultural communication, gender, Bourdieu's theory and China studies. **I am always open to conversations and collaborations with scholars working on related topics**. 

My work has been published in _Sociological Research Online_ and _Feminist Media Studies_. I have served as a peer reviewer for several international journals, including _Sociological Forum_, _International journal of intercultural relations_ and _Women's studies in communication_. I currently serve as an Assistant Editor of [Network for Research into Chinese Education Mobilities (NRCEM)](https://chineseedmobilities.com/).

My doctoral research explores how Chinese international students perceive and experience mobile dating applications, and how dating app use reshapes their understandings and practices of intimacy in transnational contexts. I am always open to conversations and collaborations with scholars working on related topics.

I received my MA degree in TESOL with Distinction from [Institute of Education, University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/) in 2019 and my BA in English language and literature from [Taiyuan University of Technology](https://english.tyut.edu.cn/) in 2018.


# Selected Experiences

My research on Chinese international students' self-presentation on dating apps has been reported in [Sixth Tone](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1017417).

## 🧑‍🏫Teaching experiences
I have worked as a teaching assistant for several courses at Durham University, including _Cultural Identity, Interculturality and Education_; _Contemporary Issues and Evidence in Education_; and _Double Dissertation: Disciplinary Contexts of Education_. I also delivered several lectures across these courses and gave a guest lecture for the module _Culture and Society of Contemporary China_ at the University of Nottingham. I also served as a keynote speaker at the Master’s conference held by the School of Education at Durham University. Prior to this, I worked as a TOEFL teacher at New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. for around two years.
